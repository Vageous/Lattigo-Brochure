# Lattigo-Brochure
---
Due to the lack of a document that can explain how to use a homomorphic encryption library called Lattigo, I decided to write a brochure for it.
A Brochure for the homomorphic cryptography library called Lattigo, which includes an explanation about how to use the specific functions, interfaces, and values in the Lattigo.

Ps: This work is ongoing and I will upload the finished documents including English and Chinese versions later.
